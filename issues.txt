Shalom, everybody!
Let's check our plans to the nearest time. These are our issues:

1. Gantverg:
Entity "Doctor". Add field: 
	retired : boolean
	+setter +getter
Add method:
	setRetired() : String
Rebuild all methods used doctors:
if doctor retired:
	- impossible to build schedule for him
	- impossible book visit
	- impossible replace visit to this doctor
	etc
	- possible view info about him
	- possible view his patients
	etc

Fleisher, Leschinsky, Gantverg:
	rebuild your implemengations of interface IHospital

2All: Sic! Impossible remove doctor or patient if there
is at least one visit in db.

2. Gantverg: build new JUnit test from Rest through Tcp to
MySql.

3. Fleisher, Leschinsky, Gantverg: check ALL responses on
requests through path: Tcp->Rest->client. They have to
have this strict structure:
Header: OK | ERROR | WRONG_REQUEST_TYPE //from TcpResponseCode
Body: 	OK = "ok" | NO_DOCTOR = "no doctor" | NO_PATIENT = "no patient" |
	NO_SCHEDULE = "no schedule on this time" |
	VISIT_BUSY = "doctor at this time is busy" |
	ALREADY_EXIST = "already exist" | NO_HEALTH_GROUP = "no healthgroup" |
	VISIT_FREE = "visit free already" | NO_ACCOUNT = "no account" |
	NO_ROLE = "no role" //from RestResponseCode
If Header == OK Body MUST be EMPTY
If Header == WRONG_REQUEST_TYPE Body MUST be EMPTY
If Header == ERROR Body MUST contains reason of error
other variants impossible!
